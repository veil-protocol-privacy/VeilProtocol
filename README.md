# VeilProtocol
Privacy in blockchain is crucial for protecting user identities, transaction details, and sensitive business data. Without strong privacy measures, users and businesses risk exposure to transaction tracking, financial profiling, and potential regulatory conflicts.

One promising approach to enhancing blockchain privacy is Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP), a cryptographic technique that proves a statementâ€™s truth without exposing its details. Our solution, VeilProtocol, using ZKP to enable confidential && privacy transactions, protect user identities, and improve overall privacy while maintaining compliance with regulatory frameworks.

We introduce VeilProtocol, is a lightweight, on-chain program that ensures privacy without the need for migrating to a separate blockchain. This approach provides : 
- Security & Decentralization: Private transactions remain trustless and secured within the existing blockchain framework.
- Seamless Integration: protocol is designed to work smoothly with existing Dapps, ensuring compatibility with the broader ecosystem.
